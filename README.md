# Java - OOPs Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java is based on four main pillars:

- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

---

### Inheritance
It means one class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class.  
Example: A son inherits his father’s house or habits.

---

### Encapsulation
It means keeping data safe and private, and allowing controlled access when needed.  
Example: A person locks their room (private) and gives others a key only when necessary.

---

### Polymorphism
It means one thing can have many forms.  
Example: The same “work” can mean different things — for a father it might be office work, for a son it might be programming.

---

### Abstraction
It means showing only important details and hiding the unnecessary ones.  
Example: A house blueprint shows the plan, not the construction details.
